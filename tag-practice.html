    <h3>About Tag Co.</h3>
    <h4>Before we weren't. Now we are.</h4> 
    <p>In the ancient times, the long long ago, when the days were dark as nights, the world was tagless.</p>
    <p>Then Tag Co. rose from the dark depths of non-being, triumpahnt as a rising sun, humanity's savior.</p>

    <h3>What's in a tag?</h3>
    <h4>That which we call a paragraph by any other tag wouldn't smell as sweet</h4>
    <p>Let's define some terms before we go any further.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Tag</dt>
      <dd>makes you feel good, organizes your stuff, calls attention to itself</dd>
      <dt>Money</dt>
      <dd>can be exchanged for goods and services, is the root of all evil, was a great Pink Flyod song</dd>

    <h3>What we do at Tag Co.</h3>
    <h4>Pretty much everything.</h4>
    <p>Here's a list of things we can do for you, arranged in order of how much money we'll need to do it right.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Tag All The Things!</li>
      <li>Some tagging, but not enough to be comprehensive.</li>
      <li>Just a touch of tagging; not really satisfying to anyone.</li>
      <li>One single tag, which only begs for additional tags.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Meet our Team</h3>
    <h4>They're pretty OK, I guess</h4>
    <p><img src="http://wdeanmedical.com/portal/images/headshot_placeholder.jpg" alt="person 1">This is a common worker. Eh. Their background isn't that important. The only reason they're at the top of the list is because their last name begins with the letter A.<a href="#">Here's their email address</a>. Please don't contact them.</p>
    <p><img src="http://wdeanmedical.com/portal/images/headshot_placeholder.jpg" alt="person 2">This is another common worker. Sure, some neat stuff happened in their life, but nothing that would convince you to buy our product, so it's not going here. <a href="#">Here is the email address for this second person</a>, even though they're so dull only a masochist would want to talk to them.</p>
    <p><img src="http://wdeanmedical.com/portal/images/headshot_placeholder.jpg" alt="person 3">This is a manager. He/she went to Harvard and has all kinds of experience in leveraging multi-channel synery. Don't you trust us now? <a href="#">Here's the email address for the manager</a>, the only one in the group who knows anything.</p>
